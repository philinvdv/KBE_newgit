                        **** Integrated Wing Structure Modeler - GKN AEROSPACE ****

--This KBE application was developed by Philippina Nikkels van der Veen and Matan Neumark (group 6)--
The purpose of the application is to be an integrated tool for the design and structural analysis of a wing.

Features:
    1. The parametric wing model allows modification of common wing geometry parameters such as span, sweep, chord lengths, etc.
    2. Structural parameters allow the user to modify the wing box structure. These include part's thickness, number of ribs and stringers etc.
    3. Mesh density can be modified at the part level
    4. An .inp file can be generated for use in Abaqus
    5. An Abaqus script to run a job and output results can be executed directly from the ParaPy GUI.
    6. Post processing of the FEM results and output plot with information about deformation and stress.
    7. Save wing configuration
    8. Load wing configuration
    9. Output a .step file for the entire assembly, or of the whole structure as a unified part.

Software requirements:
    1. Python
        Required Python packages:
            a. ParaPy abaqus adaptor
            b. abaqpy
            c. pandas
            d. numpy
            e. matplotlib
    2. ParaPy
    3. Abaqus
    4. PyCharm (recommended)

Wing design workflow:
    a. Run the 'Parametric_wing_modeller' file.
    b. In the GUI, configure the wing's geometry, structure, material and mesh to your heart's content.
    c. Optional -Name your aircraft configuration (aircraft -> input ->'aircraft_name') and save it if desired (aircraft -> actions -> 'save_aircraft_configuration')
    d. Generate an .inp file (aircraft -> actions -> 'INP_file_writer')
    e. Run FEM analysis by executing Abaqus in the background (aircraft -> actions -> 'run abaqus')
    f. Once the analysis is done, post process the results (aircraft -> actions -> 'process_results')
    g. Open the figures in the Parts/output directory to view the geometry, deformations and stresses.
    h. If the design should be tweaked (such as to eliminate stressed that cause yield), go back to step b and repeat.
    i. Once the resulting structure is satisfactory, generate a .step file.
    j. Email the .step file to your boss and go home. it's already 17:00.
